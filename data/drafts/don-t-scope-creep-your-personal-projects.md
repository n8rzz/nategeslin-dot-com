### Don’t Scope Creep Your Personal Projects

Personal projects are fun

Personal projects are a vehicle to learning new things

They should be loose, but at the same time there should be a purpose

If you’re anything like me, I go into a personal project aiming to solve a specific problem

Analysis Paralysis is a thing! A wide open green field project can be anything

Start with a reduced repo.

I like to start in codepen or for the more complicated projects, codesandbox

this gives you enough space to prove an idea. Using a sandbox also sets up up for success right away because you don’t have to spend time setting up.
