{{ SERIES? }}

A colleague of mine told me recently that I lead projects with a “People First” mentality. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure what he meant by that.

I lead projects the way I think projects should be lead. I didn’t realize I was leading in a special, or even different, way.

### What Exactly Do You Do Here?

I have a very opinionated take on what a project lead actually does. In my opinion, a project lead has six main responsibilities:

* Consume Information
* Distill Work
* **_Assign Tasks_**
* **_Foster Growth_**
* Act as Spokesperson
* **_Mitigate Risk_**

For this article, I’m going to focus solely on items three, four and six: **Assign Tasks**, **Foster Growth** and **Mitigate Risk**.

### Emotional Intelligence

When I was a young man, I wanted to grow up to be a professional pilot. Part of the training I received while pursuing that goal was heavily focused on something called [Emotional Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence).

> The ability to perceive, use, understand, manage, and handle emotions

Aviation training, and crew training especially, focuses heavily on emotional intelligence. When you are part of a flight crew you are part of a team. A team that may need to respond to life or death situations. Knowing how to properly read and respond to emotions could quite literally save a life.

I didn’t include this in the list above because Emotional Intelligence permeates every facet of working with people. When you work with people you also work with their emotions.

In software, things are rarely life and death scenarios. But the spirit is the same. In order for a team to work effectively, and work effectively together, you will need to respond to emotions.

Emotional Intelligence is one of the most critical pieces of leading with “people first”. In order for your team perform at a high level you will need to have a good handle on their emotions. Without emotional intelligence, you will never be an affective leader.

### Developer Profile

Before we can think about who should do what, we first need a mental picture of each developer’s capabilities.

While writing this article, I found myself struggling to vocalize the things I think about while I lead projects. The “Developer Profile” is something I use quite a bit in my own work. I’m sure a thing like this exists somewhere, but for the purposes of this article, we’re going to work off my version.

#### Attributes

I think about the members of my team in terms of attributes. There are 13 attributes that make up my mental model of a **Developer Profile.** I use each of these to figure out who might be best for a particular task.

* **Creativity** — Ability to think outside the box and think about solving problems in not so obvious ways
* **Communication** — Ability to those around them up to date on things as they change
* **Determination** — Isn’t deterred easily. They’ll stick with it no matter what sort of effort it takes
* **Emotional Intelligence** — Understands the situation and the \[likely\] emotions involved. Can appropriately behave given the emotion of the situation
* **Experience** — How long have they been in the industry? How long have they been doing it? How long have they been things next to it?
* **Focus** — Can they stay engaged on a thing for an extended period of time? Can they do it with distractions around them too?
* **Passion** — Are they crazy enough to go home and code too, just cause they love it so much?
* **Patience** — Do they get jumpy if things they need are taking longer than planned?
* **Precision** — When work is done, is it done surgically or is it done with a sledgehammer?
* **Problem Solving** — Do they use the scientific method when solving problems? Are they good at it? Do they typically ask for help when presented with a difficult problem?
* **Stamina** — How long can they work at a high level?
* **Teamwork** — Do they work well with others?
* **Technical Ability** — Do they have a good understanding of the technology, how it works, why, and how it might be exploited?

The magic happens with how these attributes can aid in building teams. Or how these attributes can aid in resourcing.

### Assign Tasks

what must be done now

what is coming up that this work might lead into

does anybody want to grow into this area

### Foster Growth

* know each person’s strengths
* know each person’s weaknesses
* be sensitive to emotion
* recognize when someone is starting to get burned out

Put people in a position to succeed

know in what areas a person wants to grow, then put them in a position to grow

challenge people

delegate
