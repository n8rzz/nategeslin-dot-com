When I was young I wanted to be a pilot

My friends had comic books and Highlights, I had [Flying Magazine](https://www.flyingmag.com/) and the FAR/AIM.

“**Lane Goes To Jet School**” (_from the July 2000 issue of Flying Magazine_) always stuck with me. Firstly because I loved, and still love, business jets. Secondly because of a concept she referenced in the article.

_Side note: I haven’t read this article since it was published, and I don’t have it handy to reference. So I’m paraphrasing here and I”ll likely butcher this. The spirit is the same, so please bear with me._

The concept of the article is that Lane goes to [FlightSafety International](https://www.flightsafety.com/) to learn how to fly a [Bombardier Challenger 604](https://www.google.com/search?q=Bombardier+Challenger+604&sxsrf=AOaemvIb4Q7IQbFD22KJruzQx73Ybp-uJA:1638251718942&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX84mes7_0AhWUW80KHTJMD0QQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&cshid=1638251811842938&biw=1379&bih=766&dpr=2). One of her classmates seemed to study half as much as everyone else yet aced nearly every test. She asked him how. He was former military and said the trick was simple (paraphrasing):

> There are things that are nice to know, and there are things that I **need to know. Once you understand which is which, it’s much easier to retain information**

### How Do I Use This Today

Over the years, I’ve learned that my brain is hard-wired a little differently than most people. “Nice to know vs need to know” struck a chord with me and has been with me ever since.

I collect lots of data

* email
* slack (github, jira, sass alerts, etc)

I seem to be able to put little bookmarks on the need to know stuff
