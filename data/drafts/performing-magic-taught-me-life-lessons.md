{{ RE-WORD / CONSOLIDATE}}

My sophomore year in high school was an incredibly important year in my life. It was the year I stumbled into close-up magic.

Like many, magic was something I enjoyed. I remember watching the [David Copperfield](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4PKS7V5C2t0uV1Lg0HsII6Q7303ibQRg) specials on television with my family, back when television specials were a big deal. I remember making a point of watching it wherever I could on TV, though there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of it if I remember correctly.

Before my sophomore year, close-up magic meant _card tricks._ Simple effects that were small entertainments and likely just gimmicks. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think there was a lot of skill involved in close-up magic.

Through an incredibly fortunate stroke of luck, I ended up in a class with another student who was very, very deep into magic. He and I ended up on a project together that involved playing cards and chance. He showed me that when playing cards where in the right hands, chance didn‚Äôt exist anymore.

I was hooked. This single event completely changed the course of my life. This event lead me down a path of learning and practice that would completely change how I understand the world and interact with people.

The lessons I learned, while learning and performing magic, are lessons I hold dear. I likely wouldn‚Äôt have learned them through other means. The amazing thing is that they are not profound.

Just like learning how a magic trick is done, you‚Äôre going to say out loud ‚Äúreally, that‚Äôs it?‚Äù when you‚Äôre done reading this. üòâ

### Terms

I‚Äôm going to use some words in this article that have certain meanings in relation to magic. Also, for the sake of preserving magic as _something magical_, I‚Äôm going to be intentionally vague about some if these things. If you want to learn more, search the internet starting with these terms.

**Effect ‚Äî** An instance of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù. This could be a visual change in card from black to red and the like. It could be an appearance of something in an un-expected place, the disappearance of an item, etc.

**Gimmick** ‚Äî These are the things typically sold in magic sets. These are things meant to look like a real item, that have a special modification of some kind that make them work ‚Äúmagically‚Äù.

**Routine** ‚Äî A combination of effects presented with a story. There is a beginning, middle and end and usually even have names. Some routines are very old and very famous. Ambitious Card, Twisting the Aces, Card on Ceiling, and The Reformation are some examples. The word _Trick_ can be used interchangeably with routine.

**Close-up Magic** ‚Äî Magic performed _‚Äúamong the people‚Äù._ Typically to an audience of 10 or less. Usually, the spectators are right up close to the magician during the performance. Cards and Coins are common magical items in these settings. Other items are less common like rubber bands, silverware, rings, cell phones, etc.

**Card Magic** ‚Äî Routines and effects that use a deck, or packet, of playing cards.

### Background, Part 2

There is an expectation that magic is something secret. Even today, with the internet and youtube, magic something that must be sought out. When I was learning, the internet was in it‚Äôs infancy. Things like YouTube or even Google didn‚Äôt exist yet.

In those days, magic was learned via books and VHS tapes. Obtaining those things, though, still wasn‚Äôt easy. You couldn‚Äôt just walk into a book store and buy a magic book.

Wait, that‚Äôs not exactly true.

You _could_ do that. But the books for sale were not the correct books. They typically dealt with gimmicks. Most of the bare-bones theory or mechanics were (are) found in a few specific books.

***

In order to find the material from which one could learn magic, you had to seek them out. When I was learning, there were only a few places around town where I could find this material. Even so, once I got there, the things I was looking for weren‚Äôt displayed. You had to ask for them by name.

Pretty sneaky.

### Motivation

Why am I writing about this? My wife tells me all the time that I think differently than she does. Maybe someone will find this list useful? Maybe I‚Äôm just thinking differently and everyone already knows these things?

Don‚Äôt know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

Let‚Äôs begin!

***

### Persistence

Persistence is easily the most important item on the this list. A little persistence can go a long way!

In terms of magic, persistence means trying, trying, and trying again even after failure. **_Especially_** after failure. Pushing through failures and pressing on is crucial to success. You will rarely reach any kind of success without failure.

Many effects in magic take a lot of time to learn. Like weeks, or months, or sometimes even years. The only way to learn them is to continue to fail until, magically, one day your fingers start doing things correctly.

### Practice

One can do anything with enough practice.

Practice is only hard when you‚Äôre practicing something you don‚Äôt want to do. In order to do close-up magic for an audience, one must practice **a lot.** I spent hundreds of hours in front of a mirror practicing with cards. I spend hundreds more hours practicing in front of classmates at school.

So much practice taught me two things. First, that almost anything can be learned with enough practice. Second, without practice you‚Äôll just look like a joker.

### Passion

If your heart isn‚Äôt in it then what‚Äôs the point? If you are passionate about something, things like practice and persistence come easy.

### Confidence

{{ NEEDS MORE }}

Confidence is the secret sauce. Seriously. I‚Äôve learned, humans are hard-wired to respond to confidence. Now be careful not to read that as arrogance because that is similar, but very different.

Confidence is walking up to perfect strangers with a deck of cards saying ‚ÄúDo you want to see a card trick?‚Äù Some days, that was the hardest part.

A funny thing happens, though. When you are confident, people respond. They are first a little wary, but if you‚Äôre not nice they warm up to you. Soon, after a trick or two, they are enamored.

### Flexibility

Things don‚Äôt always go the way you planned. I made a point of _never_ announcing the trick I was about to do before I did it. Sometimes a spectator would do something unexpected or I would mess something up. I‚Äôd always leave myself outs, or paths to a different effect.

From the audience‚Äôs point of view, amazing things were happening. From my point of view, I messed up Plan A but we can quickly transition to Plans B or C.

Always have a backup plan.

### Laughter

Funny thing about laughter; people usually laugh when they see magic. Something happens somewhere between seeing a thing and not being able to explain it. At worst, it‚Äôs a smile. Other times it‚Äôs full on belly laugh.

Laughter is a great way to attract other people. When people walking by hear other people laughing, especially in a group circled around someone, they get curious and join the group.
