### What If You Gamified Software Development?

Ugh, I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. For me, the word Gamified is right up there with synergy and disrupt.

It’s not what it sounds like

What if developers were like characters in a game like d&d or Warcraft?

What if we assigned tasks to them based on their traits?

Maybe I just think differently, maybe that’s how everyone else does it and I just don’t know?
